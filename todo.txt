1. Theory/simulations of robustness to ILS
   
   should probably run these without split populations?
   make sure parameters are giving expected sequence divergence
   - figure out what this percentage is from 100 genomes sequences/par reference:
     ~99.5% id w/ cer ref
     ~89% id w/ par ref
     (these numbers are calculated from only match/mismatch columns in alignments
     (gaps are ignored) so it's probably a bit of an overestimate if anything...
     unless shittiness of alignments outweighs that)

   goals of simulations: 
   establish tpr/fpr for reasonable parameters with HMM method
   pick reasonable parameters for HMM - average across different demographic models?
   show ILS is unlikely to be an issue (related to low fpr)

2. HMM algorithm -> show advantages over previous approaches; evaulate power/FPR; boundaries

3. Apply to data (maybe some new data?)
   - 100 genomes + SGRP cer
   - 37 par SGRP

4. Empirical patterns
   - how much introgression overall and per strain
   - relationship between introgression levels among strains and phylogeny/geographic
   - frequency dist
   - size differences and inferences of timing
   - functional variation/GO
   - if par analyzed, similarities or diff compared to cer
   - UNKNOWN

5. Experimental/function
   - GWAS
