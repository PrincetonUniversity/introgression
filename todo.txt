1. Theory/simulations of robustness to ILS
   
   should probably run these without split populations?
   make sure parameters are giving expected sequence divergence (~85% cer/par, x% within cer)

   goals of simulations: 
   establish tpr/fpr for reasonable parameters with HMM method
   pick reasonable parameters for HMM - average across different demographic models?
   show ILS is unlikely to be an issue (related to low fpr)

2. HMM algorithm -> show advantages over previous approaches; evaulate power/FPR; boundaries

3. Apply to data (maybe some new data?)
   - 100 genomes + SGRP cer
   - 37 par SGRP

4. Empirical patterns
   - how much introgression overall and per strain
   - relationship between introgression levels among strains and phylogeny/geographic
   - frequency dist
   - size differences and inferences of timing
   - functional variation/GO
   - if par analyzed, similarities or diff compared to cer
   - UNKNOWN

5. Experimental/function
   - GWAS
