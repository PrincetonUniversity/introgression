It's really important that the labeling of trees is correct---program
won't necessarily catch incorrectness in obvious way. For example, can
get error where transition probability rows don't add to 1. Or a
matrix singularity error from phylogeny calculations if you don't
include all ancestral labels. Not that I know this from experience or
anything.
