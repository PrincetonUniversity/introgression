figure out expectations:
- polymorphism rate (overlapping 100-bp bins starting starting at every nucleotide position; for each bin with completely aligned sequence data, calculate fraction of variable sites. (eliminate bins with very high rates, > 10 variable sites)) -> do this for within cer and between cer/par
- linkage disequilibrium (kilobases...be more specific?)


try to get better alignment
- MAVID
- the thing josh suggested
also do some summary statistics on alignment
- how much of genome aligned
- typical size of chunks

assess regions of the genome we expect to be able to find intogression in
- map of polymorphism or something



tuesday
1. calculate polymorphism across genome and overall
2. evaluate alignments
3. try other alignment programs and evaluate


///
just on chromosome I for now:
- map of polymorphism across genome to see how well we expect to be able to detect introgression
  - calculate at every site based on 100-bp window
  - average across all strains (?)
    - actually though, specifically just want to know where the two reference genomes differ
- plot other things along genome at same time:
  - recombination rates
  - gene locations
- one for each strain:
  - plot above things but also
    - where 1,2,3 genomes aligned
    - sites called introgressed
///


chromosome plot, one per strain:
- chromosome block along bottom, gray out columns where <3 genomes aligned (places we wouldn't see introgression)
- then either plot polymorphism rate, or also gray out regions below threshold polymorphism rate (this will be the same across all strains)
- plot introgressed sequence blocks, probably by just coloring the chromosome bar

chromosome plot, one overall:
- chromosome block along bottom
- plot where introgressed sequence blocks found, either line plot or colored blocks by how many strains found introgressed in, or just binary
- plot or gray out polymorhism rate
- ? plot fraction of strains where 3 genomes aligned

- recombination rate?
- genes?

notes for josh meeting:
- working on a few different things
  - getting better alignments so I can get more of a sense where we'd be able to see introgression
  - correlating introgressed regions with some other quantities across genome: polymorphism, recombination, other things
  - being systematic about choosing simulation parameters: have specific targets for sequence identity and amount/length of introgression
- plots i'll make after that:
  1. a) ILS
     b) graphical model
     c) power/comparison between methods
     d) breakpoints/length
  2. chromosome maps of introgression
  3. high frequency sequences
  4. summaries of region size and total amounts of introgression: amount/size introgressed sequence vs strain, amount of introgressed sequence vs. median size
